# Philosophers
I never thought philosophy would be so deadly

## Description
This is a project in which I studied the multithreading of the C language on a slightly modified task of philosophers from Dijkstra

## Project goals

1. Learn multithreading in C
2. Learn how to use mutexes and avoid datarace

## How to compile/to run

You open console in Linux/MacOS and enter the following commands:
```
git clone https://github.com/BioMihanoid/Philosophers
cd Philosophers
make
./philo number_of_philosophers time_to_day time_to_eat time_to_sleep number_of_times_each_phlosopher_must_eat
```

P.S. All words written after ./philo are any values (there are parameter names). number_of_times_each_phlosopher_must_eat - optional parameter
